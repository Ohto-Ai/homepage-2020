Moving the mouse over the waters will cause waves. \nIf you don't want clicking the screen switch between black/white then check out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2076082177]Blanc Noir II[/url] You can also change the colors of water and Sky using Wallpaper Engine controls in the new version.\nEnjoy!",
